  # Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "responses"
    - Complex policies causing database 500 errors
    - Invalid index creation with subqueries

  2. Solution
    - Drop all problematic policies
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies
    - Add basic performance indexes
    - Clean RLS setup

  3. Changes
    - Simple public INSERT policy for responses
    - Simple authenticated SELECT policy for responses
    - Basic indexes without subqueries
